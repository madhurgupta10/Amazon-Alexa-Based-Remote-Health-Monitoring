A simple library for using the heart rate pulse sensor in an Arduino YÃºn board (may be used in other boards too). 
Reference: https://github.com/WorldFamousElectronics/PulseSensor-Amped-Leonardo

This code is for Pulse Sensor Amped by Joel Murphy and Yury Gitman

    >>> Pulse Sensor purple wire goes to Analog Pin 0 <<<
Pulse Sensor sample aquisition and processing happens in the background via Timer 1 interrupt. 2ms sample rate.

The following variables are automatically updated:
Signal :    int that holds the analog signal data straight from the sensor. updated every 2ms.
IBI  :      int that holds the time interval between beats. 2mS resolution.
BPM  :      int that holds the heart rate value, derived every beat, from averaging previous 10 IBI values.
QS  :       boolean that is made true whenever Pulse is found and BPM is updated. User must reset.
